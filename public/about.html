<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>With over two years of experience managing diverse projects in the software development and financial services sectors, 
  I bring a robust blend of technical expertise, leadership, and a passion for delivering results that exceed expectations.

<p>In my current role as a Project Manager in a financial institution, I successfully led the implementation of a fraud detection solution to enhance real-time transaction security in the banking sector. 
  Despite encountering challenges such as data incompleteness and failed API calls, I employed meticulous planning, stakeholder engagement, and innovative problem-solving to drive the project's progress. </p>
<p>Additionally, I coordinated the development of a UI/UX project monitoring portal, seamlessly integrating contributions from front-end and back-end teams to create an efficient tool for tracking project milestones.</p>

<p>I have honed my project management expertise across various methodologies, including both Agile and Waterfall approaches. 
  This versatility allows me to tailor workflows to the unique needs of each project. 
  For instance, I have used the structured phases of the Waterfall methodology to manage projects requiring detailed upfront planning and precise deliverable sequencing, 
  ensuring milestones are met without compromising quality or scope.
